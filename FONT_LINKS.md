# Font Resources

This project uses the Inter and Manrope font families.

Download the font files from Google Fonts:

- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope)

After downloading, place the required TTF files in `app/src/main/res/font/` with the following names:

- `inter_regular.ttf`
- `manrope_regular.ttf`

These files are ignored by Git and should be added locally by each developer.
